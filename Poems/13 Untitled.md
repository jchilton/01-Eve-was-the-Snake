Dear Princess,

Do you know the sound that's made by
Windshields as they shatter into
Spiderweb designs as you are
Hanging upside-down by seatbelt
Looking at a cliff?

I don't for the adrenaline,
I'm awfully glad of that &mdash;
That chemical just aggravates me,
Says I'm close to death.
So I retreat to safer roads
Where car-rolls are unlikely
And the mental cost of driving is
Affordable to pay &mdash; but I say nonetheless that
Flipping over once is fun,
Twice I'll pass
