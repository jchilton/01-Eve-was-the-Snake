Hello Echoes
============

10/3/2013

One soul in a manila envelope
Ready for shipping says
To the soul packaged above him in the stack:
"What does it all mean?"
And that second one hears
But does not know the answer
And so does not reply,
Rudely,
Not even to acknowledge the inquisition.
Tomorrow will come regardless,
Until earth and sun are no longer
And the concept of tomorrow is obsolete
