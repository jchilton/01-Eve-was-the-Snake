Dear Princess,

Do you know the color of
A bolt of lightning as it flashes
In the fore of sky,
In shadow of the clouds of storm,
Still fore of bodewell hues?

That tint of yellow: hatchling chick
The clouds: a river stone

While underneath this scene: a red
Like sunlight seen through
Skin of loving and warm hands

And as this picture moves in time,
The ocean laps beneath.
