Oh, Bother
==========

4/7/2013

Hold still, sky, while from below I watch thee
Focused so intently on thine cloud cover I am
Staring,
Hoping that the sun will scatter them
Or that the power of my gaze will
Radiate enough energy to dissipate them
So that the short-sleeved shirt I have
Chosen does not leave me shivering cold today
If only I were a wizard
And I had that power
