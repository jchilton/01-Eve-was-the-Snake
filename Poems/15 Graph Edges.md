What can you stand on, new one?
Release it and let it flutter away until you are satisfied
Here, there, the foundation shifts to follow you
In a tribute to your impermanence

Be heartstrong in the dark
For though a path will not appear,
You leave one
Maybe another can follow

Illuminate a here & now
Because the heres & nows are scarce,
Costly and
Rouletted to some
