Iridescent Tantaleyes
=====================

Mystery girl &mdash;
You are unapproachable like a blinding diamond
And beautiful like fission in a star
But I have earned my stripes
In the war of the genders,
And your red pants and opalescent eyes
Will not make me lose my cool.

You are a manslayer,
But I am impervious

And which one of us will tahashsham in this hashama?
