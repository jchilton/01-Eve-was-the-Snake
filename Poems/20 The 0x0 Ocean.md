The 0x0 Ocean
=============

9/3/2014

(Start at an artsy coffee house)
The most beautiful paints are
Wept onto canvas post-aging in an innocent's memory
(Stop to breathe)
Such that in effect the iris
Is an asymmetrical filter,
Taking ugly on ingest and context on emit
Leaving quintessential feeling (breathe)
(Why'd you break the rhythm?
We were just getting set up to divulge all of a friend's memories)
(Stop to breathe & look merely complacent)
(There's no rhyme or cadence
[With cigarette in-hand]
Which makes confidence-breaking acceptable)
(Now put the microphone in the stand & make some grand gesture: which is up to you)
(Do you wear glasses? [Let's get really off-track -- there's a bar down the street;
Tell directions to the crowd & get go-ing])
(Now we're here, yes, and so:)
On the beach, at the ocean,
The Pacific Northwestern water
Freezes the body and so --
The experience is purely physical when
It could otherwise have been
(Reminder to tip the bartender)
(Breathe) psychosomatic (this just isn't the time or place
To mention what we came here to say.)
