1. Life on this side of the whip
   is not a permanent crisis
   despite sideways rain on the ill-lit highway
   and traveling abstractly towards an ambulance
   and literally to a place where
   I want to be more than I want to be in my own bed
   What are all these comforts about?
   What I need to get by in lieu of a reciprocal.
2. Hopefully the status quo will accept me as integral
   and the blooming, daisy-petal-counting children
   won't pay me much mind.
3. If only I could control the urge
   to address apologetic poetry to former lovers, and
   never-readers anyway.
