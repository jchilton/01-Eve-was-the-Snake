The Colding
===========

10/9/2013

Here again, the winter blossoms
Isn't that chill-on-wind awesome?
Where are the animals of late?
They're in their nests to hibernate.
Leaves from trees fall, orange and brown,
From branch to earth a-swirling down.
A thousand crystalline beads form
When dew's the opposite of warm
