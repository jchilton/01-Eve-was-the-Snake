Tea For One
===========

10/23/2014

A bouncing ball
A world on fire
A gaslit slave
A parking stall

A mind that ticks
As axons twine
In pathways through
An active mind

I once loved her
Uselessly
But love this strong's
Not meant to be

I'm letting go
And channeling
The love I felt
To other things

It's like screaming at the top of your lungs in a vacuum
