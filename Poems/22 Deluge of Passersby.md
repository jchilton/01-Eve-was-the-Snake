Deluge of Passersby
===================

10/23/2014

There was a cataclysm at the beginning of time
When all potential souls each cried out,
"I am not ready for life. Nullity is so much
easier."
But the dual-roled charioteer-shepherd waited patiently,
At times urging them to action and
At times pushing them away &mdash;
Not due to unloving,
But so that they might find their paths
