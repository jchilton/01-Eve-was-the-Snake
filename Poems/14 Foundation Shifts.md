Foundation Shifts
=================

9/22/2013

Aren't we anonymous automatons in the flowing wax and ebb of unsympathetic economy?

Don't we slog in an improvised shuffle,
An elaborate swirl of energy expenditure which satisfies
Apparent self-organizing forces?

Is it a plight to live on the wrong side of the line dividing
The satiated and the wanting?
Do we tell ourselves that no holier judge can say which side is which?

Will our identities converge when age numbs the vagaries of life?
Were our souls complicit in strife before we were born?
