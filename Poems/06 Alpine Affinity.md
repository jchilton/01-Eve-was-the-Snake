Familiar meadow-in-plateau amidst peaks
Bounded by woods, here wild flowers grow
And snakes and rodents move about, unseen
A beetle crawls up a stem, antennae twitching
Instantly the hard wings open; the bug waits briefly,
Then flies off to greener fields,
Winding in the breeze which also carries
Pollen up and aimlessly like prayers
