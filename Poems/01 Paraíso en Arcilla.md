Para√≠so en Arcilla
==================

3/27/2013

So shone abalone &mdash;
Rounded shells in lands where sun sees the evening
And value is known in creases at the edges of eyes and smiles

A child finds that shell
And imagines that if the sun were rising over the horizon instead of setting
Then she could more easily crease the smiles in her eyes
Although the rising sun illuminates the shell
And its green and purple hues smile out over the water
As it transitions from a world of dark and blue
To one of light and shades of red
So the child's longing to be on a western shore passes as she
Blinds herself by staring
Into the road of fire that the sun paints in a reflection on the ocean
From the horizon to the shore at her feet
