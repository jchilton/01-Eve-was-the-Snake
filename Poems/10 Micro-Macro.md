Strings
watch
as they dance
alone in nothing else

muons, pions, several quarks
too numerous to count

protons, atoms, molecules
a trillion at a time

to organelles and cells
and macrobiostructure

bacteria and viruses
diseases and their cures

pro- and eukarya
and vertebrate, mammalia

the quadruped, the plantigrade
the ape who walks on two

and wears a shoe and cardigan
and makes everything over again

Known
now
as a thing
encoded in a book

theory, art, science and math
too enumerated to name

emergent structure
and attribute

to economy and power
and craft of war

crime and punishment
and society and justice

newspaper and radio
and television, internet

atomic bomb and satellite
the astronaut in space

who comes home and
has to use a toilet just like everyone else
