Nullspace of a Matrix
=====================

4/5/2013

So raucous shone the alpenglow
O'er doe in meadow sleeping
While mountain birds elapsed in the pre-dawn light,
Their chirps heard by two hikers
Aloft in the eerie aura of a sacred place,
Their occasional branch-to-branch flitting
Suspending a stranger to propriety,
Bringing his mind here and now
