The Other Black Gold
====================

7/30/2013

Dregs of coffee stir in veins
To ease the awful waking pains
I ought to try but won't succeed
In getting by without the need
To caffeinate; it's an addiction
More than that I need the friction
Of a night without much sleep
The words I push my drink may keep
So here's to ever-sleepless nights
And artful, long internal fights
With demons who doth disappear
When the sun is nowhere near
For in the night my fear gives way
To creativity gone in the day
And peace of mind and will at hand
So begone sandman, take your sand

Here's to coffee, rev my heart
And at the dusk, at nighttime's start
I'll re-up with another round
So that my pillow needn't be found
And like a font I'll keep to spring
Until the earth completes a ring
And may words flow until the sun
Comes up and my nocturnal fun
Ends suddenly and with a daze
And off to bed I slowly laze
But then recall that molecule
And think to myself, "I'm a fool
It's daytime, I shall be awake"
And so another pot I make
And sleepless life is thus maintained
Until I crash, empty again
